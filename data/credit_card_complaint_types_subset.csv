Credit card or prepaid card,Unauthorized transactions/trans. issues,"I had 3 unauthorized transfers from my American Express Serve Card to 3 different people, that are unknown to me & the transfers were NOT authorized. # 1  on  XXXX  for {$260.00}  # 2   XXXX  for {$780.00} & # 3 on  XXXX  for {$1000.00}. Each time these transfers occurred, I notified  American Express Serve, where they changed my password, PIN & secret question. Money was still transferred from my account following the security changes. I kept being told that I was 100 % Fraud Protected with my Card but the bank had up 10 days to resolve the dispute. I called frequently requesting updates gradually becoming more frustrated now being told they have 45 days to resolve the dispute as I was "" A victim of Identity Theft '' .The card credited me back the {$780.00} only & REFUSES to speak to me about the other 2 un authorized transactions after daily calls requesting updates.   I called on  XXXX  & asked to speak with an individual in the Fraud  Dept  & was informed they DO NOT ACCEPT CALLS. I became upset and requested they send me an e-mail update. Within an hour,   American Express Serve sent me an e-mail stating they closed out the account stating "" I violated the contract '' & that "" I authorized the transfers ''. American Express Serve also REFUSED to permit to speak with a representative regarding this matter. I have had health issues over this, my utilities shut off, incurred late fees & now have to move next week without the deposit money.

Credit card or prepaid card,Unauthorized transactions/trans. issues,"I am very upset with this company. They have violated my rights several times to the fullest extent and I have had it! My card was compromised and used, therefore my funds were taken out. I called and filed a claim, that of course, got denied. I called this company SEVERAL TIMES as to why my claim was denied and they flat out refuse to tell me or send me the documentation that I requested for as proof as to why I lost the dispute, WHICH IS ILLEGAL. Furthermore, their employees are rude,  XXXX , and DO NOT  SPEAK   XXXX   WELL,  which makes it harder to communicate and causes them to mix up my information.  XXXX  of the reps hung up on me, another  XXXX  kept talking over me, and even most of their reps ( who seem to be the same all the time ) are unprofessional and even calls me  XXXX , when I am a  XXXX . Also, keep in mind that I have the hardest time communicating with this company. I had a previous claim that got denied, but then honored in my favor because I was in the right. However, it took me  THREE MON THS of calling, letters, writing, re-disputing, arguing, etc. just to get it resolved in my favor that should 've been in my favor the whole time. Even when I requested for a callback from the disputes department, they call around  XXXX  when I told them several times to call past  XXXX  PST, but they still DO NOT LISTEN AFTER  XXXX  CALLBACKS! The reps name was  XXXX  who denied my last claims which I believe might still be her who is denying it. This company thinks they are always right and flat out do what the  XXXX  they want. It is time this company stops violating peoples right and listen up! Because at this point, I am being or feel discriminated since the customer service rep told me that my account got closed b y the "" Risk Dept '' due  to suspicious activity on my account ( which I reported before ). So therefore, it make me believe that it boils down to concerns with terrorism/money laundering, that I DO NOT DO. The reason why I feel this way is because they know my ethnicity and the rep on the phone basically admitted it and believes that there is no reason why my claim should be denied and my account be closed. I woke up today to text messages saying my card has been blocked and that t here may be an issue  with my account. Myself was not able to login and when I tried to, it said that my account is locked and to call cust srvc, which was the same exact message when my card was being used without my permission. If their company can not speak  XXXX  well, then there is going to be a mix up of info, which is also how my claims get denied too. I HAVE A RIGHT TO FILE A CLAIM! I still, to this day, have not even got a chance to respond to the merchants response to the dispute for a rebuttal because I have n't even received the documents that were used in the investigation which again is violating my rights.

Credit card or prepaid card,Fraud or scam,"I regularly leave the country. Always before leaving I notify  American Express se rve. Each time I am told I do n't need to notify them as the card will work wherever  American Express  is accepted. Recently I left to  XXXX . I had a regular payroll direct deposit hit my account while away on   XXXX   XXXX   evening. Once this deposit hit, I made a charge at my hotel in  XXXX  for about {$250.00} and submitted a bill pay for {$50.00}. When I tried to use my card at the ATM it was declined. When I tried to use my card again at my  XXXX  hotel it was declined. I called  Amex a nd was told that ATM transactions were not allowed overseas. I inquired about the hotel charge I attempted and was declined and was told that my account was suspend. I assumed it was for suspicious activity so I offered to confirm my transactions and attempted transactions. I was also asked to confirm the amount of my most recent direct deposit which I did. I was given no recourse to have the account unlocked except that the process takes  24-28 h ours to resolve as it had to be escalated to a separate risk department that the representative nor their supervisor had access to except via email. I called back the next day to get a status and was told that I had violated the terms of the card and that my account was being closed and a check for the remaining {$800.00} or so dollars would be mailed to me. At this point I could no longer log in to my account to see any information. I spoke with a supervisor who then informed me that the prior information was n't true and that the account would be unlocked as soon as the thing that triggered the account suspension, a tax direct deposit was verified/confirmed. I informed them that I did not have any tax deposit coming into the account. I confirmed again that I only had a partial payroll deposit that deposits biweekly from the same company for the entire time I have had the card. I advised them to look at the account to see. The  manager says she look ed and saw that the deposit did come from payroll and was the same payroll deposit i regularly get but was still unable to unlock the account. I then asked her to verify the amount of the alleged tax deposit, She did, it was the exact same amount of the payroll deposit. She then said that their system must have read it as a tax return. they verified that there were no unauthorized charges and as is my regular practice I leave majority of my funds in my reserve account and transfer over what I need to use so as to avoid any unauthorized charges in the event of a lost or stolen card. I informed her of the urgency as I was out of the country and needed access to my funds. I have since called everyday to inquire about the status of the hold and each da y I am told they will escalate the inquiry and to wait an additional 3-5 business days on top of the days I have already been w aiting.I have called corporate in  XXXX , the  executive office and spoken with supervisors and managers, each time they are telling me there is nothing they can do and t hat I should wait an addition al 3-5 business days from the current day, not from the first day i call ed on   XXXX   XXXX  . Today I was told to wait until the   XXXX  , tomorrow. When the rep came back on the line, he said, wait another  3-5 b usiness days from today because this is going to take more time. I have currently been on hold for a  manager for  an hour. This has to stop, they can not hold my money  hostage a nd then tell me whatever they want at the time.

Credit card or prepaid card,Fraud or scam,"On  XXXX   XXXX  I tried to log into my  American Express  account online but was unable to do so. I then called them to help me to unlock my account which took  3  or 4 times of them trying to unlock the account. I did just end up calling the phone service line and getting my balance from the card. That is when I realized that something was wrong, because a large amount of money was missing so I then called them back again. When I told the company that the money was missing a representative said we could file a claim so she then transferred me to another representative who then asked me many questions and said that he would have an investigator look into it. He told me that I was going to get all the {$5000.00} back because I was covered by the fraud prevention program. He then said to expect a call from their investigator with some more questions. I did not receive a call from the investigator or anyone else from AE for that matter so I called them on Saturday the  XXXX . The representative on the phone said that I should give them a call back on Tuesday the  XXXX  to see where the investigation is at.

When I called them today they told me that the investigation was closed and that they closed my card account because I somehow defaulted on the agreement. I then asked to speak to the supervisor so I could get more answers. I waited on hold for ten minutes when the supervisor finally came on he said that they had closed the fraud claim case because they said it was my fault.

Credit card or prepaid card,Unauthorized transactions/trans. issues,"One day on the way to a friends house, for some unknown reason at the time, XXXX. Upon XXXX I realized I was in the hospital and was being transferred to another one. When I finally XXXX and was able to react to things, I realized all my possessions were missing. My wallet, my phone, my keys and all the contents of my bag. My identity had been stolen and fake accounts made in my name. They used all my information and even gained access into my netspend account. I filed a dispute with netspend and waited 2 weeks for them to deny my claim for reasons that they could n't even explain to me. So I took it to a higher level because I was not even contacted during their "" investigation ''. They did n't even have any of my hospital documents. So I was assured that this would be taken care of ... That following Monday I am contacted to be told once again that my dispute claim has been denied.. Why I ask? Only to be told it was because my pin number was used and that I could get the investigation documents sent if I wanted them. 
Of course I want to see why I wont be getting my money that I worked for. These are the 3 reasons why my claim got denied and why I believe its inaccurate. 
1. The pin transactions are consistent with previous transactions.. 
They are not consistent with any previous transactions. They happened at some of the stores and atms I have been to before but the amounts, times, and frequency are wrong. They pulled up transactions from last year and they clearly show me spending {$20.00} dollars at XXXX and nothing more. The person who had my card spent over {$100.00} at XXXX more than 5-6 times. They pulled up XXXX transaction from last year as well where it shows me spending less than {$50.00} at a time but this person spent {$980.00} at XXXX. All the transactions are to the extreme and they say that it matches previous account activity? Really netspend? How does it match previous account activity if its only at the same store but for totally different amounts and not just different but extremely over the top. 
2. Pin was not changed 3. My account balance was checked in a way I have before ... 
If someone has stolen my identity and all my stuff, the limits are endless on what they can do. They even went as far to open accounts in my name and even used my email to do it. They had my phone, S.S. card, I.D . and debit cards. Now I have to be punished because somebody had my pin and went to stores I went to last year? Even though I provided you with hospital documents and proved that it was not me. I have never filed a dispute before and have been with netspend for over 2 years. Any card company I have ever had and never had to file a dispute. The same thing happened with my XXXX XXXX card only difference is I already got my money back from XXXX XXXX. Netspend get it together please because this is not fair to me. I have had thousands come through this account and payed over the top fees for months and did n't complain but now when its time for you to do your part of protecting me and my money, I have to literally fight for my money. This is not right and where is the costumer service at for incidents like this. I just really want to be helped so that I can continue on with my life and pay my bills.

I looked at the transaction history and an IVR Transfer was done in the amount of {$1000.00} plus a {$1.00} IVR Transfer fee. -See printout ( How did they know the amount to take out? Even with my account info they could n't see my actual account ) XXXX/XXXX/17 @ XXXX. I called Direct Express @ XXXX. I kept getting a recording saying they were busy and to call later. I was extremely upset! I kept calling over and over until I finally got through. 

I explained the situation. The lady looked at my account then said I needed to be transferred to a level XXXX rep. When she transferred me it again went to a recording that they were busy and to try again later!! By this point I was furious!!! 


At about XXXX. I finally got through again. I again explained the situation and again she said I would need to be transferred to a level 2 rep. I asked her if there was a way to make sure I get through because I had already been through this! She said no. I would just need to keep trying. I said ok! Ill call this number over and over until this is resolved!! Someone stole my money!! When she transferred me I could still hear the noise on her line so she must have warm transferred me. 

I again explained the situation. The guy asked me some questions then said he would forward my dispute to the investigation team and I would receive paperwork in the mail that I need to complete and send back. I asked if he knew how long it would be before I would receive my money back. He said he was n't sure depends on the investigation team. I asked if he was saying I had to wait until after they did the investigation before I would see it. He said yes. I told him I will lose my house and car! He told me he would put a note that I had important payments to make. I asked him if they could just stop the transfer since when I have done transfers its always taken 3 days. He told me no. That the thieves did it to where it was automatic. Like a cash withdrawal. That the money was gone. I asked how the heck they did that? He could n't answer. I then asked if I should make a police report and he said yes, that would speed the process a little.

I had explained they did n't seem to either want to give me info or have info when I had spoken to them. He gave me a case number ( XXXX ).

Credit card or prepaid card,"Managing, opening, or closing account","Hello, I recently set up my first online business called XXXX XXXX. This whole process has been a complete learning process for me. After getting off to a slow start, business finally started to pick up for the month of XXXX. I made sure that every single order was processed and shipped out. Now, due to technical issues with my email support server at XXXX, customers were receiving there order confirmation, but were not receiving their shipping confirmation ( tracking numbers ). Being that customers were not receiving there shipping confirmation emails, they began to get worried and as a result, some customers opened disputes on PayPal as there only way of communication. Once I realized the trend with customers saying they are n't receiving tracking and that emails to XXXXXXXXXXXX were not able to be sent, I quickly called XXXX and worked with them to resolve the issue ( support email is working fine now ). As a result of all the disputes filed, PayPal placed an account limitation on my account which prevented me from accessing my money and demanded I provide extra documents and resolve all of the open disputes. ( Fair enough for the commotion ) During this whole process I was working hand in hand with paypal, sent all the required documents, updated every single customer tracking number, and called every single day to resolve all of the open disputes. I 've dealt with very helpful agents, as well as agents who really did not want to help me at all. At one point they even permanently banned me and realized they did not have any reason to, being that I was working with them diligently, and all the information was presented, ( i.e : confirmed proof of deliver to numerous disputes that were opened ), that they appealed there decision and brought my account back to temporary limited access. I had since been working tirelessly to close out all of the disputes, even taking it as far as allowing PayPal to issue full refunds to certain customers for the inconvenience of the whole situation and still allowing them to keep the product they paid for. On XXXX/XXXX/2017 after working with paypal for over an hour, I was finally able to close out all of the disputes. The representative I worked with was amazing and really helped me out. She then transferred me to the limitation department for review and I was greeted by an underwhelming agent who sounded like she hated her job and was n't so motivated to help. She did not allow me any opportunity to explain my situation at hand prior to her decision. After she had already made the decision to permanently ban my account I literally had to beg her to allow me to speak to someone else. She finally got her supervisor to review the account for me, after he reviewed my account, he said there is nothing they can do because I had already had been granted an appeal before, which was absolutely ludicrous. The only reason I had to even get an appeal done was because I had to deal with an agent who messed up and sent my account to review even though I was not even close to closing off the disputes. Of course they would ban my account, and of course I would have to call them and have them check there records and realize there was no reason for all that to have been done, no reason for my account to have been sent for review so early in the first place, being that everything was being worked on faithfully and with honest intentions. I tried to explain this whole situation to them but they were unwilling to even consider my reasoning and just continued to reiterate there is nothing they can do. This whole situation started from a third party issue with my email server hosted by XXXX and it has since been resolved, so to be banned after spending so much time and effort working with PayPal to prove I am a legitimate business is completely unfair and I really feel like I have been XXXX over big time.",2415990,"Once I realized the trend with customers saying they are n't receiving tracking and that emails to were not able to be sent, I quickly called and worked with them to resolve the issue ( support email is working fine now ).

Credit card or prepaid card,Unauthorized transactions/trans. issues,"My son, bless his heart, gave me a {$25.00} Mastercard Gift Card for XXXX last year. He paid {$3.00} to have it activated. I put it away to use in a few months for something I really wanted - the card was NEVER OUT OF MY POSSESSION in fact IT WAS NEVER OUT OF MY HOUSE. I signed up online to validate the card but then I put it away. When I finally tried to use the card about 3 months later it was denied and when I looked online 3 charges had been made that used up the card. The card has never been out of my possession and it is very suspicious that all 3 of the charges were made at a XXXX Gas Station in XXXX, Missouri and XXXX, Missouri which is close to where my son bought the card. I called right away and was told to fax in a bunch of stuff which I did and had to pay for the fax fee. Then later they said MAIL US SOME STUFF which I did and paid for postage - a month later they wrote me and said SORRY YOU WAITED too long - there is a 3-month time period you have to contact us by. They did n't say 3-months past what? It should n't matter because THEY CHOSE to allow charges to be made without the card present. But it does n't matter to them because they got their money so XXXX me and my son too. But it was not 3 months past the last charge was added but there is no warning that people copy the 3-digit code and can use these. They say KEEP IT IN A SAFE PLACE which I did - they do n't warn you that you better check it EVERY DAY or someone might steal your money. So this is just wrong - they let the money be stolen and they do n't warn you when you buy it that they will let someone steal your money. If I had the card locked up in a bank vault somewhere would have made no difference.

I want to know when my Google Wallet Account was created. Google Wallet Reps, Google Support Reps, Google Play reps, account experts, account specialist, and the Google legal Dept have ignore and have assisted XXXX in Consumer Fraud. I did not create my Google Wallet. It was created for me as I have been told and stated in complaints. The charges for Google Wallet started XX/XX/XXXX. Google did not announce to the public that there even was a Google wallet until XX/XX/XXXX. The very first charges was to Google Wallet not Google Play from XXXX. There were XXXX seperate charges seconds apart to my XXXX bill. How did XXXX get my Google Wallet Account information to bill that first charge. In XX/XX/XXXX I recd a email from Google stating I had potential FTC refunds because I was told by Google they could not return carrier billing I had to go to the carrier which was XXXX. I knew there were outstanding refunds. I called Google and stated that the charges were not made by a minor but I wanted my money back and wanted to make sure I would not be in trouble for requesting the carrier billing. The email directed me to the Google Play site and I saw many refunds that were not processed. There was never any transaction number tied to these charges but I notice in Google play that the first charges were not listed. I went to Google and asked how do I request the charges that arnt in Play store. I was told in write there were numerous customers experiencing the issue and it should be fixed after the holidays. In XX/XX/XXXX I had a Google Payments Account created ( not by me ) and was told by Google Payments Rep that I could personally see my charges in Google Payments and instructed me how to access. When I did the only way I could access my charges was to agree to Google Payments terms and conditions. When I did all charges were deleted from the Wallet Account and put on the Google payments account with the XXXX that was originally taken from the account now showing that it was XXXX. Google denied altering records.Per Google Wallet Rep XXXX in email in XX/XX/XXXX state that invoice were processed in XX/XX/XXXX and sent to the bank in XX/XX/XXXX. The charges are completely different. I would like Google to explain why they have conceal Financial Fraud.I was told by my attorney that XXXX wanted to settle then the case was dismissed for not reporting the charges within the first year. As I was made aware of the charges to the account XX/XX/XXXX, I found out well over a year of the first charge. If Google would of protected my account none of the events would of happen.Within two weeks of getting the XXXX services there were charges to wallet. Google is aware of that yet when the flagged the account for fraud they decided they knew better than the account holder and cleared the flags that was one day before they notified the public about wallet.

I want Google to explain exactly what was done and why instead of explaining and helping me they have repeatedly lied and tried to confuse the situation so I would drop it. If this is how Google is allowed to do business how many others are there? Google has stated to me there were other customers experiencing problems, were those charges also deleted as mine were?

The card was declined. I wonder why when I have close to {$1000.00} saved up so I proceed to try a second time. That 's when I reached out to the card customer service. I was advised that my card was at a negative. They went over numerous transactions which I was completely unaware of. I immediately asked them to shut the card down and requested for a Dispute Form so that I could file a claim. I did everything I was advised to do. File a police report and submitted it along with the completed Dispute on the XX/XX/2017. Today, I received the frustrating and disappointing letter from them indicating that the claim was denied because these were face to face transactions and the card was present. This is completely appalling because I had the card the entire time. I was using the card at work when these transactions were fraudulently being conducted some where else. I 've been struggling these past couple of weeks because this is money I put aside for my every day needs as I am a single mother every penny counts. It will be a great hardship for me to loose these funds. I 'd like to file a formal complaint on this company for the way they have handle this situation.

Credit card or prepaid card,Fraud or scam,"I was given a visa gift card for my birthday, with a balance of {$100.00}. The card says it was issued by US Bank. 

Several months later I removed the card from its original packaging and tried to register it on the provider 's website. When I tried to register the card to verify the balance, I found it had already been used for the full amount on the card, leaving a XXXX-dollar balance. 

I called the customer service number as printed on the card and filed a claim. I was informed the transaction had taken place in a XXXX store in California on the day before my birthday. 

This week I was informed that my claim had been denied, because I had not filed it within 120 days of the gift card 's fraudulent use. 

As the card had remained in the original packaging until XX/XX/XXXX, and there were no instructions on the packaging indicating I was required to register it within a certain time period, I did n't have any information that I suggested registering the card and checking its balance was anything other than optional. 

Doing research online, this turns out to be a widespread problem, that has been going on for some time. There are a number of articles online describing others that have fallen victim to this scam. Some claim that hundreds of complaints are received each day. 

Unfortunately, the corporation selling these cards has yet to take any action to either prevent this fraud, or to warn customers of the risk of the fraud and what they must do to protect themselves should the card 's account be used for unauthorized purchases. No warning is given that if the card is not registered within a particular time frame that the card holder will not be reimbursed for the fraudulent activity.",2400759,"This week I was informed that my claim had been denied, because I had not filed it within 120 days of the gift card 's fraudulent use.

Credit card or prepaid card,"Managing, opening, or closing account","I received a pre-paid VISA from XXXX which was issued by CITI Group in the amount of {$150.00} in XXXX. It had an expiration date of XX/XX/XXXX. A copy of the card is attached. I misplaced the card and I did not use the card by that date. I found the card in XX/XX/XXXX. I asked XXXX to issue me another one - they told me I had to talk to CITI. I called CITI XX/XX/XXXX and they told me that the card was no longer valid and that they could not issue me another one, nor could they give me any money - they said that the card showed a zero balance due to it having not been used by the prescribed use-by date of XX/XX/XXXX. 

Now fast forward - I read somewhere that what CITI told me was not correct. I called CITI again on XX/XX/XXXX and this time they told me that the card did in fact have a balance of {$120.00} - I asked them why it only had a balance of {$120.00} and they told me that it was being surcharged {$3.00} per month for being dormant. I asked them to give me the {$120.00} - in some form or fashion - either a check, reactivate the card or issue a new card. CITI told me that they could not return the money to me - that is a pretty good trick - The money is there and they get to keep it until they surcharge it down to nothing even though I have asked for the money or another card. This seems like a dirty rotten way to do business - and I hope that you can do something about this. Again, when I talked to CITI in XX/XX/XXXX they told me one thing and then in XX/XX/XXXX they told me something else.

Credit card or prepaid card,Unauthorized transactions/trans. issues,"Executive Summary On Friday XX/XX/XXXX I, XXXX, purchased a {$500.00} VISA Debit Gift Card from XXXX located at XXXX GA XXXX at XXXX EST from the main customer service kiosk. The associated VISA Debit Gift Card account number ( PAN ) is XXXX EXP XX/XX/XXXX CCV XXXX with proxy ID XXXX issued by XXXX under contract with Black Hawk Networks. 

On Friday XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to use the {$500.00} VISA Debit Gift Card referenced above to make a point of sale purchase at XXXX, GA XXXX at approximately XXXX EST, and experienced a card authorization decline at point of sale utilizing card ending in XXXX. 

Upon contacting XXXX shortly after experiencing the card authorization decline, at telephone number XXXX, I learned the following facts and reported the card as compromised due to suspected fraud Shortly upon activation of the card at XX/XX/XXXX XXXX EST, the card was registered to a "" XXXX '' in zip code "" XXXX '' via channels unknown, but most likely via XXXX. No IP address information was available when asked. 

It is my understanding and belief that the person registering the VISA Debit Gift Card likely at one time obtained or had an co-conspiring associate gain physical access to the instrument with details of the following data parameters required to register the card. It is my professional judgement an employee of XXXX likely may have been involved in the compromise of the instrument. 

Fraud case regarding the {$500.00} VISA Debit Gift Card ending in XXXX was filed with card issuing bank, XXXX, at telephone number XXXX with case number XXXX. 

Various individual transactions we performed between {$1.00} and {$490.00} with an aggregate total less than {$500.00} during the XXXX hour on XX/XX/XXXX at the following merchants. These transactions were unauthorized by me, the legitimate card holder. 

Dispute case was opened with XXXX on Friday XX/XX/XXXX. 

Copies of XXXX Police Department report were forwarded to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Documentation and evidence to support claim, including proof of XXXX bank statement screen shot showing I was the legitimate purchaser of the pre-paid debit card, was provided by electronic mail to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I was reimbursed for the fraudulent use of this card by XXXX directly on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Blackhawk Networks indicating the investigation had been concluded and that "" after further review of the cardholder 's dispute claim we have found no error has occurred. As such, your case is considered resolved and closed ''. This statement is in direct contravention of the consumer protections enumerated in Federal Reserve Board Reg E governing the use of credit / debit / pre-paid card instruments. While I have been made whole by XXXX, a separate and distinct entity from Blackhawk Networks, I find Blackhawk Network 's arbitrary and capricious closing of my dispute case and finding of "" no error has occurred '' to be factually incorrect. I am bringing this matter to the attention of the US Consumer Financial Protection bureau as I am concerned other legitimate consumers may be adversely affected by Blackhawk Network 's arbitrary and capacious closing of REG E dispute claims with findings of "" no error has occurred '' in direct contravention to sworn statements, facts, police reports, etc.",2351186,"Upon contacting shortly after experiencing the card authorization decline, at telephone number I learned the following facts and reported the card as compromised due to suspected fraud Shortly upon activation of the card at EST, the card was registered to a "" '' in zip code "" '' via channels unknown, but most likely via Documentation and evidence to support claim, including proof of bank statement screen shot showing I was the legitimate purchaser of the pre-paid debit card, was provided by electronic mail to on It is my understanding and belief that the person registering the VISA Debit Gift Card likely at one time obtained or had an co-conspiring associate gain physical access to the instrument with details of the following data parameters required to register the card.

I also faxed Netspend evidence. I have included my attachment evidence that I sent to Netspend in this complaint.

I addressed in this email that 2 swim lessons had already been cancelled. The next email was XXXX admitting that these 2 lessons were cancelled and that I had paid in full for my membership. XXXX email went on to say that she would speak with her superior to see what she could do about the lesson that I paid for which I was being cheated because the XXXX cancelled it. As you can see from the emails, XXXX ignored me for almost 3 weeks, during this time, I was not being allowed to safely use the pool which again, was part of my Paid membership, because the lifeguards refused to do their job during pool hours. Most times there were No lifeguards when I was trying to practice. This is a service I Paid for that I was being denied a right to use. This means, I was also not allowed to use my paid membership. This is a direct violation of my consumer rights.
